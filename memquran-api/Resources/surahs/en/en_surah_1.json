It was revealed to the Prophet -peace be upon him- in Makkah in the early period of his mission. The Surah has seven verses.","The Surah is both a Du'a (prayer) and an introduction of the Qur'an.  It teaches the basic principles of Islamic faith. All praise and thanks are for Allah who is the Lord of all the worlds. Allah is most merciful and most compassionate. Allah is also the Master of the Day of Judgment.  We should pray to Allah only and we should seek His help.  We seek His guidance and help to walk on the straight path.  This is the path of those who received Allah's favors, not the path of those who incurred His anger or who went astray.</p>"],"Verses":[{"Verse":1,"Text":"بِسۡمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ","End":"١"},{"Verse":2,"Text":"ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ","End":"٢"},{"Verse":3,"Text":"ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ","End":"٣"},{"Verse":4,"Text":"مَٰلِكِ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِ","End":"٤"},{"Verse":5,"Text":"إِيَّاكَ نَعۡبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسۡتَعِينُ","End":"٥"},{"Verse":6,"Text":"ٱهۡدِنَا ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلۡمُسۡتَقِيمَ","End":"٦"},{"Verse":7,"Text":"صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ غَيۡرِ ٱلۡمَغۡضُوبِ عَلَيۡهِمۡ وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَ","End":"٧"}],"Translations":[]}
